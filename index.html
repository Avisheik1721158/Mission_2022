        <p>
            In the previous years, I committed many things.
            But some things I have forgotten. This is the new year; I have to learn new things and apply them in real
            life.
            Focus is the essential thing to the way of success. When I want to learn a new skill, I have to focus until
            I reach my goal.

                Mission
            </h2>
            <p>
                I want to be a full-stack developer. Firstly, I should learn the frontend part. As a frontend developer,
                I have to know HTML, CSS, javascript, react, etc. Then I want to make a different type of project to use
                this type of language, as I should create a professional profile like LinkedIn and Github. Then I have
                to move the backend part like SQL PHP MongoDB.

            <h2>
                Vission
            </h2>
            <p>
                When I have completed almost all parts of the language, I have to prepare for a job interview. Also, I
                have to prepare a bit of problem-solving. When I search for a software company to get a job, I will make
                a resume carefully. I have to be sure that all the requirements to make fulfill.

            <h2>
                Goals
            </h2>
            <p>
                Software engineer and web developer jobs are based on experience.
                When I have more experience in the job field, I can easily find a better job. I have to learn new
                technology besides when I will do my job.
                The main point is that I should make my profile like a pro and gather more experience in that field.
                Hopefully, I will reach my goal.

                As a developer, you have no limit to finding your flow. So I should maintain my focus, determination,
                concentration and value my time until I reach my success.
