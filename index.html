            The author explains the trend of gift-giving on the occasion of holidays, birthdays, anniversaries,
            weddings,
            graduations and baby showers. The answer to the question lies in line 28-30.
            People tend to buy gifts that recipients would not choose to buy on their own, or at least not spend as much
            money
            to purchase. This phenomenon is referred to as 'the deadweight loss'. This phenomenon is described as
            predictable as
            gift-givers are not very good at predicting what gifts others will appreciate.
            Also, it is itself not surprising to social psychologists.

        Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence through an ordered, logical progression
        of ideas. There are a number of useful techniques for expanding on topic sentences and developing your ideas in
        a paragraph. Illustration in a paragraph supports a general statement by means of examples, details, or relevant
        quotations (with your comments).

        In Harry’s world fate works not only through powers and objects such as prophecies, the Sorting Hat, wands, and
        the Goblet of Fire, but also through people. Repeatedly, other characters decide Harry’s future for him,
        depriving him of freedom and choice. For example, before his eleventh birthday, the Dursleys control Harry’s
        life, keeping from him knowledge of his past and understanding of his identity (Sorcerer’s 49). In Harry Potter
        and the Chamber of Secrets, Dobby repeatedly assumes control over events by intercepting Ron’s and Hermione’s
        letters during the summer; by sealing the barrier to Platform 93⁄4, causing Harry to miss the Hogwarts Express;
        and by sending a Bludger after Harry in a Quidditch match, breaking his wrist. Yet again, in Harry Potter and
        the Prisoner of Azkaban, many adults intercede while attempting to protect Harry from perceived danger, as Snape
        observes: “Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from
        Sirius Black” (284). All these characters, as enactors of fate, unknowingly drive Harry toward his destiny by
        attempting to control or to direct his life, while themselves controlled and directed by fate
